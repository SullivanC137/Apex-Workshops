# Quick refresh

This is a repository of a training day for a client. If you are an experienced PL/SQL developer who has already attended few Apex courses but you need a refresh, then you are the target audience.</br>
The assignment is to get you up to speed as fast as possible.</br>
This is not a training for Apex developers as we will walk trough many standard features of Apex. It is, however, part of a series which can also benefit experienced developers. Check the other workshops if you are interested.

## Our model.
For this training we will use old reliable [EMP DEP schema.](db/empDep.sql)

## Our Apex.
For compatibility reasons we will use version: 5.1.4

## Instructions
Each set of exercises has its own instruction folder and an apex application which you can import and compare with your own app.</br>
Start with [the first one.](instructions/empDep.sql)
