# Going the distance

This is a repository of my third workshop at Qualogy Caribbean. It's divided into 4 parts and each part has its own set of instructions and a downloadable app, so you can continue with the next part if you were not finished with the previous one.
In this workshop you will be developing an application where racing events can be managed. After the workshop you will be able to add,
edit or delete runners, events and results to the database and also run some pretty graphs and reports.

If you are doing this workshop on apex.oracle.com, please load the [base ddl script](db/createDatamodel_InsertData.sql) before starting.
