# Data validations, some business logic and graphs
In this module we will be adding some data validations and logic to our application. We will also end with a few graphs.
This module is mostly code along. Watch the trainer and then do it yourself.

### Requirements
Each runner can only have one result per event. This means:
1. When adding a new result we have to make sure that there are no results entered for this runner for our chosen event.
2. When updating a current result we have to make sure that there is exactly 1 result entered for this runner for our chosen event.
3. Error message: "A runner can only have one result entered for an event".

Instructions:
On your event result form:
1. Add a validation:
   * Name = "Unique runners result on insert"
   * Type = No rows returned (view help text).
   * When button pressed = CREATE
   * SQL Query: (replace 12 with your page number)
   ```` sql
   select 1
   from   event_results
   where  runner_id = :P12_RUNNER_ID
   and    event_id  = :P12_EVENT_ID
   ;
   ````
2. Add another validation:
   * Name = "Unique runners result on update"
   * Type = No rows returned (view help text).
   * When button pressed = UPDATE
   * SQL Query:
   ```` sql
   select 1
   from   event_results
   where  runner_id =  :P12_RUNNER_ID
   and    event_id  =  :P12_EVENT_ID
   and    id        != :P12_ID
   ;
   ````
3. Optional: Make the start time mandatory.

### Data validation on event result
A result must be entered in format: hh:mi:ss. (hours:minutes:seconds)
1. A user should visually be made aware of the expected format.
2. Error message: "Expected format = (hours:minutes:seconds)"

Instructions:
1. Add following text into Value Place Holder field for your start time and end time items:
> hh:mi:ss
2. Add a validation for start time:
   * Name = Start Time format OK
   * Type = SQL Expression
   * SQL Expression:
   ```` sql
   to_number(substr(:P12_START_TIME,1,2)) <= 24
   and
   substr(:P12_START_TIME,3,1) = ':'
   and
   to_number(substr(:P12_START_TIME,4,2)) <= 59
   and
   substr(:P12_START_TIME,6,1) = ':'
   and
   to_number(substr(:P12_START_TIME,7,2)) <= 59
   ````
   * Associated Item = P12_START_TIME
   * Server side condition = Item is NOT NULL
   * Item = P12_START_TIME
3. Do the same for end time

### Extend your result report with running duration per runner
Edit your results report: change it from table based to query based with following query:
```` sql
select er.id,
       er.event_id,
       er.runner_id,
       er.start_time,
       er.end_time,
         to_char(
         trunc(sysdate) +
         (to_date(sysdate||' '||end_time,'dd-mon-yyyy hh24:mi:ss')
          -
          to_date(sysdate||' '||start_time,'dd-mon-yyyy hh24:mi:ss')
         ),'hh24:mi:ss')
         duration
from   event_results er
````

### Add two filters to your running reports: event, runner
Instructions:
1. Add a region before the results region:
   * Title = Search
   * Type = Static Content
2. Add two new buttons to this search region:
   * button 1: SEARCH
   * button 2: RESET
3. Add two new items to this search region: (change 11 to your page number)
   * Name: P11_EVENT_ID
   * Type = Pop Up LOV, use shared component
   * Name: P11_RUNNER_ID
   * Type = Pop Up LOV, use shared component
4. Add a proces to this page to reset and clear the page cache
   * Name = reset
   * Type = Clear session state
   * When button pressed = RESET
5. Change the report Query to:
  ```` sql
  select er.id,
         er.event_id,
         er.runner_id,
         er.start_time,
         er.end_time,
           to_char(
           trunc(sysdate) +
           (to_date(sysdate||' '||end_time,'dd-mon-yyyy hh24:mi:ss')
            -
            to_date(sysdate||' '||start_time,'dd-mon-yyyy hh24:mi:ss')
           ),'hh24:mi:ss')
           duration
  from   event_results er
  where (er.event_id = :P11_EVENT_ID   or :P11_EVENT_ID is null)
  and   (er.runner_id = :P11_RUNNER_ID or :P11_RUNNER_ID is null)
  ````
6. Page Items to submit: P11_EVENT_ID,P11_RUNNER_ID (in report settings)
7. Save and run

### Add a graph showing how many results are entered per event
Instructions:
1. Page Designer --> Add Page --> Blank Page (Charts) --> New navigation (Parent = events)
2. Create a new region in this page:
   * Title = Results per event
   * Type = Chart
   * Series, Source Type = SQL Query:
   ```` sql
   select (select count(*)
        from   event_results er
        where  er.event_id = e.id
        ) value
    ,       e.name label
    from events e;
    ````
   * LABEL = LABEL , VALUE = VALUE
3. Save and run
